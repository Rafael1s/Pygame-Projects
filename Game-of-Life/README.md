In this project, Conwey's game of life is implemented.   
In this, for every p greater than or equal to 14, it is possible to construct a glider gun in which     
the gliders are emitted with period p. [Bill Gosper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gosper) discovered the first glider gun in 1970, earning prize from Conway.    

The frontend of the notebook **game_of_live.ipynb** (see version 120x100)    
has the following interface:   

* Enter - start the game
* Esc   - escape from the game 
* Space - stop and clear (generations counter is reset (in red))
* p     - pause the game
* f     - read the game initial position (opens the file dialog)
* w     - save the  game initial position to the file 
* click - create the cell in the current location
* right click - remove the cell in the current location
