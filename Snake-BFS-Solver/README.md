The BFS (Breadth First Search) solver makes the snake to eat the apple along the shortest path     
if it thinks that particular path will be safe for the snake. Otherwise, it makes the snake    
to move until it finds a safe path, in particular, the solver looks for a path to the snake's tail  
and tries to change the path to the apple each time.
